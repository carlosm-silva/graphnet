## CRITICAL RULE: SLURM Queue Configuration

This rule is **non-negotiable** and must be followed in every instance to prevent significant financial costs.

### 1. For Batch Job Files (`.sbatch`)

**Rule:** Before writing or modifying any file with a `.sbatch` extension, you **MUST** ensure it contains the following exact line in its directive section:

```
#SBATCH -qembers
```

**Action:** If the line is missing, **add it** before saving the file.

### 2. For Command-Line Execution

**Rule:** Before running any SLURM command that allocates resources or submits a job (e.g., `sbatch`, `salloc`, `srun`), you **MUST** ensure the command includes the queue flag:

```
-qembers
```

**Action:** If the flag is missing, **modify the command to include it** before execution.

**Example Scenarios:**
- If the user asks to run `salloc --nodes=1`, you must execute `salloc --nodes=1 -qembers`.
- If the user provides a script with `srun my_program`, you must execute `srun -qembers my_program`.
